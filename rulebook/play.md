## Overview of Sequence of Play

The basic sequenece of play for Operation Stingray can be visualized with the following hierarchy.

```
     TACTICAL PHASE 1
     |
     |__ Impulse 1
     |   |
     |   |__ Government Segment
     |   |   |__ Movement
     |   |   |__ Battle
     |   |__ Rebel Segment
     |       |__ Movement
     |       |__ Battle
     |
     |__ Impulse 2
     |
     |__ Impulse 3


     TACTICAL PHASE 2
```

Let's break down each piece of the sequence.

### Tactical Phases

At the broadest level, `The Toyota Wars` plays out as a sequence of Tactical Phases. Each Tactical Phase is characterized by different fundemental rules and conditions for movement and battle. For example, the first Tactical Phase of Opération Manta happens during rainy season; wells are more available to units in the desert, but marshes are more troublesome to navigate in the savanna. The second Tactical Phase, on the other hand, happens during the dry season. For this reason alone it can be useful to think of Tactical Phases as six-month tropical seasons.

### Impulses 

Each Tactical Phase is split up into three Impulses. An Impulse is the basic "round" for Toyota Wars, during which each player plays one turn. We might say, then, that each Tactical Phase lasts three "rounds."

### Segments

During each Impuse, the government players plays first, and the rebel player plays second. Each player's turn is called a Segment. For the government, a Friendly Segment is a Segment during which the government plays; for the Rebel Player, it is the Segment during which the Rebel Player plays.

### Movement and Battle Phases

During each players Segment, the player first moves whichever unit the wish to move, and then proceeds to attack any enemy units within attacking distance. In other words, a player's turn can be split up into a Movement Phase and a Battle Phase.

### Diagram

Below is map of the sequence of play which can be used for reference during the game. More than just the basic hierarchy of the sequence of play (see above), this chart also helps visualize _events_ which happen just before and after the above _phases_ of the game. For example, after each Impulse, and before the next Impulse begins, units not stationed on a water supply are eliminated. This is an important event that falls outside of a movement or battle phase.

### Victory Conditions

The game ends immediately if either Habre or Goukouni are eliminated; the player with the surviving Commander is declared the victor. 

In the event that both players fail to eliminate the rival commander, the player who occupies N'Djamena with any type of ground unit after a given length of time wins the game. In the Opération Manta scénario, this legnth of time is equal to two Tactical Phases — one rainy season, and one dry season. In other words, an Opération Manta game lasts a maximum of two Tactical Phases, representing a full year of companining.

## Game Setup

###  Combat Units Setup

#### <span class="blue">Government Forces</span>
   
   **Head of Government** : FAN Commander HABRE in Abeche `3633`

*   4x FAN guerrillas in Biltine `3730`
*   4x FAN guerrillas in Sudan Sanctuary
*   3x MPLT guerrillas and MPLT leader in Mao `1631`
*   1x PLA guerrilla and PLA leader in Mongororo `4239`
*   1x FANT 7-3-6 infantry battalion each in N'djaména `1537` and Ati `2734`
*   1x FANT 2-2-6 infantry company each in Mongo `2838`, Am Timan `3442`, and Boudougour `1642`
*   2x FANT 2-2-6 infantry companies in Salal `2429`
*   2x FANT 2-2-8 recon companies in Abeche `3633`

#### <span class="red">Rebel Forces</span>
   
   **Rebel Commander**: FAP Commander GOUKOUNI in Fada `3922`.

*   3 x FAP guerrillas in Oum Chalouba `3627`
*   1 x FAP guerrilla in Fada `3922`
*   2 x FAP guerrillas in Faya-Largeau `3020`
*   2 x FAP guerrillas in Kirdimi `2819`
*   3 x CDR guerrillas and CDR leader in Koro Toro `2826`
*   3 x CODOS guerrillas and CODOS leader in Korbol `2446`
*   7 x MRP guerrillas and MRP leader in Moundou `1849`

The seven MRP guerrillas are considered independent at the start of the game, and may not move until activated. (Place an "IGF" marker on top of the stack to indicate this fact.) If attacked by one player, they are immediately activated and controlled by the other player. Otherwise, the Rebel player attempts to activate them by rolling one die during "Initiative Determination" of each Tactical Phase. MRP joins the Rebel side on a result of 5 or 6.


#### <span class="green">Intervention Forces</span>

FAP Allies: Libyan Task Force P
- 2 x Legion 8-1-10 armor battalions in Fada `3922`
- 1 x Legion 8-1-10 armor battalions in Ougui `2315`
- 2 x Legion 5-2-6 infantry battalions in Oum Chalouba `3627`
- 3 x Legion 5-2-6 infantry battalions in Djikdjik `3522`
- 1 x Legion 5-2-6 infantry battalions in Monou `4225`
- 2 x 10-2-10 armor battalions in Bardai `2308`
- 2 x 8-2-10 mechanized battalions in Faya `3020`
- 2 x 7-4-6 commando battalions in Koro Toro `2826`
- 2 x 7-4-6 commando battalions in Ounianga Kebir `3516`

### Player assignment

Roll a single dice to decide which player initially controls the government. 
- _n ≤ 3_: player who rolled is Government Commander (Habré)
- _n ≥ 4_: player who rolled is Rebel Commander (Goukouni)

## Pre-Tactical Phase
<map-large></map-large>

### Season Switch

Each Tactical Phase corresponds to a single, roughly six-month season; rainy season, or dry season (in reality, rainy season only lasts as long as six months in the southernmost parts of Chad).

Odd numbered Tactical Phases are Rainy Season. What this means for gameplay is that:
- all wells marked on the map are functional
- all marshes on the map restrict movement (see <!--insert link here-->Terrain Effects Chart for details)

Even numbered Tactical Phases are Dry Season.
- only perennial wells are functional
- only perennial marshes restrict movement (see <!--insert link here-->Terrain Effects Chart for details)

### Guerrilla Water Check

<!--clarify this-->

## Tactical Phase

## Pre-Impulse
<map-large></map-large>

### Guerrilla Sanctuary Adjustment

All guerrilla units in the "New Arrivals" section are moved into the main portion of each Sanctuary box, where they are free to re-enter the hex grid.

### Intervention Task Force Adjustment

All intervention units located in the Task Force Losses box are transferred to the appropriate Reinforcements & Replacement box(es).

## Impulse

Below are the two Impulse segments: Movement and Battle. The government player goes through both segments, then the rebel player does. The Impulse is repeated three times per Tactical Phase.

### Movement
<map-large></map-large>

#### Basic Procedure

Units move individually or in stacks through the hex grid, expending movement points (MP's) for entering various kinds of terrain, infiltrating out of enemy-occupied hexes etc. Not unit may ever exceed its printed movement allowanve, unless it moves only a single hex. While one player moves units, the other player is not allowed to move any units.

#### Enemy Occupied Hexes

There are no Zones of Control in Chad. Units may freely enter and exit hexes adjacent to enemy units without any penalty or additional cost.  

Generally, units may not enter hexes containing enemy units. However, under certain specific conditions, adjacent units can actually pass through an enemy occupied hex (Infiltration, Leader Overrun, or Air Transport/Airmobile Movement). Units may NEVER and movement in or attack from a hex containing enemy units.  

**Infiltration** : A guerilla unit or leader that is adjacent (or moves adjacent) to an enemy-occupied hex may move through (infiltrate) the target hex into another hex adjecent to the target. Conventional units may never infiltrate. An infiltrating unit must have sufficient MP's remaining to pay for all terrain costs in the target hex AND the destination hex. The infiltrator must also pay ONE additional MP if the target hex is occupied by enemy guerilla units and/or FANT units; or TWO additional MP's if uf the target hex contains any Libyan or French combat units. Infiltration may NEVER occur through a hex containing any OAU combat units of a Fortification marker. If an infiltrator's destination hex contains non-OAU enemy units without a FOrtification maker, the infiltrator must have sufficient MP's remaining to continue infiltrating until it reaches a destination hex that does not contin any enemy units. Units unable to begin (orcontinue) infiltration must either select another movement path, or cease movement entirely for the segment.  

**Leader Overrun**: A unit (including Commander of guerrilla leader) is not required to stop or expend any additional movement points when entering a hex occupied solely by an enemy Commander of guerrilla leader(s). If the moving unit is a combat unit, the Commander and all leaders n the hex are immediately eliminated. Follow normal procedures for eliminating Commanders and leaders.

#### Stacking Limitations

Stacking is calculated using each unit's Step value. Step Values are listed on the Unit Costs and Values Chart. Commanders and Leaders limits never count against stacking. Stacking limits apply to ALL combat units (enemy and friendly) at the conclusion of the movement portion of EACH player segment of an impulse. They also apply throughout the combat portion of each player segment. At those times, each hex on the map must contain a Step Value of NINE (9) or less, regardless of terrain. <!--(For variable stacking, see optional rule 13.20.)--> 

An unlimited number of guerrillas may occupy a Sanctuary box designated for their use. No units may occupy Sanctuary Entry hexes at the end of a player segment. Units in violation of these stacking limits and restrictions are eliminated (owning player's choice). 

**NOTE**: no substitutions or "breakdown" of larger units into smaller units is allowed during movement.
