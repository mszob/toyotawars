## Overview of Sequence of Play

The sequenece of play for Operation Stingray can be summarized with the following hierarchy.

```
     Tactical Phase 1
     |_ Impulse 1
     |  |_ Government Segment
     |  |  |_ Movement
     |  |  |_ Battle
     |  |_ Rebel Segment
     |     |_ Movement
     |     |_ Battle
     |_ Impulse2
     |  |_ Same as Impulse 1
     |_ Impulse3
        |_ Same as Impulse 1

     Tactical Phase 2...
```

Let's break down each piece of the sequence.

### Tactical Phases

At the broadest level, `The Toyota Wars` plays out as a sequence of Tactical Phases. Each Tactical Phase is characterized by different fundemental rules and conditions for movement and battle. For example, the first Tactical Phase of Opération Manta happens during rainy season; wells are more available to units in the desert, but marshes are more troublesome to navigate in the savanna. The second Tactical Phase, on the other hand, happens during the dry season. For this reason alone it can be useful to think of Tactical Phases as six-month tropical seasons.

### Impulses 

Each Tactical Phase is split up into three Impulses. An Impulse is the basic "round" for Toyota Wars, during which each player plays one turn. We might say, then, that each Tactical Phase lasts three "rounds."

### Segments

During each Impuse, the government players plays first, and the rebel player plays second. Each player's turn is called a Segment. For the government, a Friendly Segment is a Segment during which the government plays; for the Rebel Player, it is the Segment during which the Rebel Player plays.

### Movement and Battle Phases

During each players Segment, the player first moves whichever unit the wish to move, and then proceeds to attack any enemy units within attacking distance. In other words, a player's turn can be split up into a Movement Phase and a Battle Phase.

### Diagram

Below is map of the sequence of play which can be used for reference during the game. More than just the basic hierarchy of the sequence of play, this chart also helps visualize _events_ which happen just before and after the above _phases_ of the game. For example, after each Impulse, and before the next Impulse begins, units not stationed on a water supply are eliminated. This is an important event that falls outside of a movement or battle phase.

### Victory Conditions

The game ends immediately if either Habre or Goukouni are eliminated; the player with the surviving Commander is declared the victor. 

In the event that both players fail to eliminate the rival commander, the player who occupies N'Djamena with any type of ground unit after a given length of time wins the game. In the Opération Manta scénario, this legnth of time is equal to two Tactical Phases — one rainy season, and one dry season. In other words, an Opération Manta game lasts a maximum of two Tactical Phases, representing a full year of companining.

## Game Setup

###  Combat Units Setup

#### <span class="blue">Government Forces</span>
   
   **Head of Government** : FAN Commander HABRE in Abeche `3633`

*   4x FAN guerrillas in Biltine `3730`
*   4x FAN guerrillas in Sudan Sanctuary
*   3x MPLT guerrillas and MPLT leader in Mao `1631`
*   1x PLA guerrilla and PLA leader in Mongororo `4239`
*   1x FANT 7-3-6 infantry battalion each in N'djaména `1537` and Ati `2734`
*   1x FANT 2-2-6 infantry company each in Mongo `2838`, Am Timan `3442`, and Boudougour `1642`
*   2x FANT 2-2-6 infantry companies in Salal `2429`
*   2x FANT 2-2-8 recon companies in Abeche `3633`

#### <span class="red">Rebel Forces</span>
   
   **Rebel Commander**: FAP Commander GOUKOUNI in Fada `3922`.

*   3 x FAP guerrillas in Oum Chalouba `3627`
*   1 x FAP guerrilla in Fada `3922`
*   2 x FAP guerrillas in Faya-Largeau `3020`
*   2 x FAP guerrillas in Kirdimi `2819`
*   3 x CDR guerrillas and CDR leader in Koro Toro `2826`
*   3 x CODOS guerrillas and CODOS leader in Korbol `2446`
*   7 x MRP guerrillas and MRP leader in Moundou `1849`

The seven MRP guerrillas are considered independent at the start of the game, and may not move until activated. (Place an "IGF" marker on top of the stack to indicate this fact.) If attacked by one player, they are immediately activated and controlled by the other player. Otherwise, the Rebel player attempts to activate them by rolling one die during "Initiative Determination" of each Tactical Phase. MRP joins the Rebel side on a result of 5 or 6.


#### <span class="green">Intervention Forces</span>

FAP Allies: Libyan Task Force P
- 2 x Legion 8-1-10 armor battalions in Fada `3922`
- 1 x Legion 8-1-10 armor battalions in Ougui `2315`
- 2 x Legion 5-2-6 infantry battalions in Oum Chalouba `3627`
