## Overview of Sequence of Play


The sequenece of play for Operation Stingray can be summarized with the following hierarchy.

```
     Tactical Phase 1
     |_ Impulse 1
     |  |_ Government Segment
     |  |  |_ Movement
     |  |  |_ Battle
     |  |_ Rebel Segment
     |     |_ Movement
     |     |_ Battle
     |_ Impulse2
     |  |_ Same as Impulse 1
     |_ Impulse3
        |_ Same as Impulse 1

     Tactical Phase 2...
```

Let's break down each peice of the sequence.

### Tactical Phases

At the broadest level, `The Toyota Wars` plays out as a sequence of Tactical Phases. Each Tactical Phase is characterized by different fundemental rules and conditions for movement and battle. For example, the first Tactical Phase of Op√©ration Manta happens during rainy season; wells are more available to units in the desert, but marshes are more troublesome to navigate in the savanna. The second Tactical Phase, on the other hand, happens during the dry season. For this reason alone it can be useful to think of Tactical Phases as six-month tropical seasons.

### Impulses 

Each Tactical Phase is split up into three Impulses. An Impulse is the basic "round" for Toyota Wars, during which each player plays one turn. We might say, then, that each Tactical Phase lasts three "rounds."

### Segments

During each Impuse, the government players plays first, and the rebel player plays second. Each player's turn is called a Segment. For the government, a Friendly Segment is a Segment during which the government plays; for the Rebel Player, it is the Segment during which the Rebel Player plays.

### Movement and Battle Phases

During each players Segment, the player first moves whichever unit the wish to move, and then proceeds to attack any enemy units within attacking distance. In other words, a player's turn can be split up into a Movement Phase and a Battle Phase.

### Diagram

Below is map of the sequence of play which can be used for reference during the game. More than just the basic hierarchy of the sequence of play, this chart also helps visualize _events_ which happen just before and after the above _phases_ of the game. For example, after each Impulse, and before the next Impulse begins, units not stationed on a water supply are eliminated. This is an important event that falls outside of a movement or battle phase.
