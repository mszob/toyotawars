## Understanding the Military Situation

### Commanders

#### Habré and Goukouni
   
`The Toyota Wars` is a two-player simulation of the Chadian civil war between Hissène <span class="blue">Habré</span>, Commander of the Armed Forces of the North (<span class="blue">FAN</span>), and <span class="red">Goukouni</span> Oueddei, Commander of the People's Armed Forces (<span class="red">FAP</span>). Libya, France, the USA, and the Organization of African Unity (OAU), may intervene and assist in various ways, but the larger political decisions on which intervention is based are not controlled be either player.
   
In the Opération Manta scenario, Habré is the government Commander. During the course of the game, Goukouni may become the government Commander by capturing the capital city, N'Djmanéna (1537).

Roll a dice to decide which player initially controls the government. 
- 1-6: player who rolled is government Commander (Habré)
- 7-12: player who rolled is rebel Commander (Goukouni)


### Combat Units
Combat units which Habré and Goukouni have at their disposal:

#### Conventional Units
   Government Allies

- <span class="purple">FANT</span>: government army. Although put together by Habré, these units come under Goukouni's control if he succeeds in taking control of the government.
- <span class="white">French Stingray units</span>, Marine and Air force. Controlled by any government player.
- <span class="yellow">OAU</span>, African union peacekeeping forces. Controlled by any government player.

FAP Allies
- <span class="green">Libyan Task Force P</span>: troops Qadafi lends to his ally Goukouni. Qadafi's goal is to get Goukouni in power because he knows he is a weak leader and will augment his chances of annexing Chad once the civil war is over.</p>

#### Guerrilla Units
  
In addition to the FAN and the FAP, there are a total of 12 other Guerrilla Factions, whose allegiance to one of the two Commanders will vary throughout the game.

   FAN Allies

- <span class="blue">FAN</span>. This is Habré's personal army. Weather Habré is government commander or rebel commander, FAN remain loyal to him.
- MPLT allied rebel troops.
- PLA allied rebel troops.

FAP Allies
- <span class="red">FAP</span>. This is Goukouni's personal army. Weather Habré is government commander or rebel commander, FAP remain loyal to him.
- CDR allied rebel troops. 
- CODOS allied rebel troops.

Neutral
- MRP guerrillas are neutral, or "inactive". However, these guys will turn against whoever attacks them first out of an attempt to take Moundou. Opposite player commands them fro that time on.

  Alternatively, government player can attempt to rally them with a roll of the dice (see rules).

##  Combat Units Setup

#### Government Forces 

   
   **Head of Government** : FAN Commander HABRE in Abeche (3633)

*   4x FAN guerrillas in Biltine (3730)
*   4x FAN guerrillas in Sudan Sanctuary
*   3x MPLT guerrillas and MPLT leader in Mao (1631)
*   1x PLA guerrilla and PLA leader in Mongororo (4239)
*   1x FANT 7-3-6 infantry battalion each in N'djaména (1537) and Ati (2734)
*   1x FANT 2-2-6 infantry company each in Mongo (2838), Am Timan (3442), and Boudougour (1642)
*   2x FANT 2-2-6 infantry companies in Salal (2429)
*   2x FANT 2-2-8 recon companies in Abeche (3633)

#### Rebel Forces
   
   **Rebel Commander**: FAP Commander GOUKOUNI in Fada (3922).

*   3 x FAP guerrillas in Oum Chalouba (3627)
*   1 x FAP guerrilla in Fada (3922)
*   2 x FAP guerrillas in Faya-Largeau (3020)
*   2 x FAP guerrillas in Kirdimi (2819)

*   3 x CODOS guerrillas and CODOS leader in Korbol (2446)
*   7 x MRP guerrillas and MRP leader in Moundou 1849)

The seven MRP guerrillas are considered independent at the start of the game, and may not move until activated. (Place an "IGF" marker on top of the stack to indicate this fact.) If attacked by one player, they are immediately activated and controlled by the other player. Otherwise, the Rebel player attempts to activate them by rolling one die during "Initiative Determination" of each Tactical Phase. MRP joins the Rebel side on a result of 5 or 6.


#### Intervention Forces

FAP Allies: Libyan Task Force P
- 2 x Legion 8-1-10 armor battalions in Fada (3922)
- 1 x Legion 8-1-10 armor battalions in Ougui (2315)
- 2 x Legion 5-2-6 infantry battalions in Oum Chalouba (3627)
- 3 x Legion 5-2-6 infantry battalions in Djikdjik (3522)
- 1 x Legion 5-2-6 infantry battalions in Monou (4225)

## Victory Conditions

The game ends immediately if either Habre or Goukouni are eliminated; the player with the surviving Commander is declared the victor. Otherwise, the player who occupies N'Djamena with any type of ground units at the end of 10 rounds wins the game.
