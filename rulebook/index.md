## Understanding the Military Situation

### Commanders
   
`The Toyota Wars` is a two-player simulation of the Chadian civil war between <span class="blue">Hissène Habré</span>, Commander of <span class="blue">F.A.N.</span> (Armed Forces of the North), and <span class="red">Goukouni Oueddei</span>, Commander of <span class="red">F.A.P.</span> (the People's Armed Forces). Libya, France, the USA, and the Organization of African Unity (OAU), may intervene and assist in various ways, but the larger political decisions on which intervention is based are not controlled be either player. Due to foreign intervention, The Toyota Wars repeatedly errupted into full-blown international conflict and invasion from Lybia. For this reason, the Toyota Wars are sometimes considered to be a series of conflics between Chad and Lybia, rather than the drawn-out civil way between Habré and Goukouni.

There are multiple possible scenarios to chose from when playing `The Toyota Wars`, each of them covering a specific period in the Chadian civil war and its geopolitical concequences.
- The [Opération Manta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Manta) scenario covers a two-year period in the war between 1983 and 1984. This period is characterized by the invasion of Libyian forces into Chad and France's attempt to prevent such an invasion from toppling Habré's government in N'Djaména. The French intervention was codenamed Opération Manta, or "Operation Stingray."

In the Opération Manta scenario, Habré is the initial Government Commander. During the course of the game, Goukouni may become the government Commander by capturing the capital city, N'Djmanéna.

Roll a dice to decide which player initially controls the government. 
- 1-3: player who rolled is Government Commander (Habré)
- 4-6: player who rolled is Rebel Commander (Goukouni)


### Combat Units
Below are all combat units which both commanders have at their disposal.

#### Conventional Units

#### Conventional Government Allies

- <span class="purple">F.A.N.T.</span> Government army. Although recruited by Habré, these units come under Goukouni's control if he succeeds in taking control of the government.
- <span class="white">Opération Manta</span> French Marine and Air Force units from the Stingray task force. Controlled by any government player. France's goal is to maintain a friendly relationship with any government of her former colony, in order to continue benfitting from economic and military agreements.
- <span class="yellow">O.A.U.</span> Peacekeeping forces from the Organization for African Unity. Controlled by any government player.

#### Conventional F.A.P. Allies
- <span class="green">Task Force P</span> Lybian troops, some of them from the Islamic Legion, sent by Qadafi to aid his Chadian ally Goukouni. Qadafi's goal is to get Goukouni in power in order to augment his chances of controlling Chad once the civil war is over. Qadafi's collaboration with Goukouni can sometimes look a bit more like an invasion...</p>

#### Guerrilla Units
  
In addition to F.A.N. and F.A.P., there are a total of 12 other Guerrilla Factions participating in the civil war. Their allegiance to one of the two Commanders will vary throughout the game.

##### F.A.N. and Guerrilla Allies

- <span class="blue">F.A.N.</span> Habré's personal army. Whether Habré is government commander or rebel commander, F.A.N. remain loyal to him.
- MPLT allied rebel troops.
- PLA allied rebel troops.

##### F.A.P. and Guerrilla Allies
- <span class="red">F.A.P.</span> Goukouni's personal army. Whether Goukouni is government commander or rebel commander, F.A.P. remain loyal to him.
- CDR allied rebel troops. 
- CODOS allied rebel troops.

##### Neutral
- MRP guerrillas are neutral, or "inactive." However, these guys will turn against whoever attacks them first out of an attempt to take Moundou. Opposite player commands them fro that time on.
Alternatively, government player can attempt to rally them with a roll of the dice (see rules).
