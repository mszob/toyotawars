# Introduction and Game Setup

> It is possible to begin playing `Toyota Wars` without necessarily having read the bulk of the game introduction on this page ahead of time. In that case, the players must simply follow the instructions in the [Combat Units Setup](/rulebook/#combat-units-setup) portion of this page and then skip straight to the [Play](/rulebook/play) section of the Rulebook. During gameplay however, necessary portions of this introduction will be referenced for player comprehension!

## Understanding the Military Situation

Below is a brief historical introduction to `The Toyota Wars`. For more in-depth historical details which are not indepseansble for understanding gameplay, visit our [history corner](/)!

### Commanders
   
`The Toyota Wars` is a two-player simulation of a series of military conflicts that played out between 1983-1987 in the country of Chad. These conflicts included a civil war, the overthrowing of the Chadian government by commander Hissène Habré, and the invasion of the country by neighboring Libya under Muammar Gaddafi.

<!--<span class="info"> 

The terms "Toyota Wars" or "Toyota War" are sometimes used to refer to portions of the Chadian civil war of 1982-87, and sometimes used to refer to the [final phase of the Chadian-Lybian conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chadian%E2%80%93Libyan_conflict#Toyota_War), which lasted from 1978 to 1987.

</span>-->

`The Toyota Wars` primarily focuses on the civil war between [Hissène Habré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiss%C3%A8ne_Habr%C3%A9), Commander of <span class="blue">FAN</span> (Armed Forces of the North), and [Goukouni Oueddei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goukouni_Oueddei), Commander of <span class="red">FAP</span> (the People's Armed Forces). <span class="green">Lybia</span>, <span class="white">France</span>, and the <span class="yellow">OAU</span> (Organization for African Unity), may intervene and assist in various ways, but the larger political decisions on which intervention is based are not controlled be either player. 

There are multiple possible scenarios to chose from when playing `The Toyota Wars`, each of them covering a specific period in the Chadian civil war and the Chadian-Lybian conflict.
- The [Opération Manta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Manta) scenario covers a two-year period in the war between 1983 and 1984. This period is characterized by the invasion of Libyian forces into Chad and France's attempt to prevent such an invasion from toppling Habré's government in N'Djaména. The French intervention under President François Mitterand was codenamed Opération Manta, or "Operation Stingray." Habré had toppled Goukouni's gouvernment the year before the Lybian invasion and Opération Manta, in 1982.

In the Opération Manta scenario, Habré is the initial Government Commander. During the course of the game, Goukouni may become the government Commander by capturing the capital city, N'Djmanéna, with the help of the invading Lybians.

Roll a dice to decide which player initially controls the government. 
- 1-3: player who rolled is Government Commander (Habré)
- 4-6: player who rolled is Rebel Commander (Goukouni)


### Combat Units
Below are all combat units which both commanders have at their disposal.

#### Conventional Units

##### Conventional Government Allies

- <span class="purple">FAN</span> Government army. Although recruited by Habré, these units come under Goukouni's control if he succeeds in taking control of the government.
- <span class="white">Opération Manta</span> French Marine and Air Force units from the Stingray task force. Controlled by any government player. France's goal is to maintain a friendly relationship with any government of her former colony, in order to continue benfitting from economic and military agreements.
- <span class="yellow">OAU</span> Peacekeeping forces from the Organization for African Unity. Controlled by any government player.

##### Conventional FAP Allies
- <span class="green">Task Force P</span> Lybian troops, some of them from the Islamic Legion, sent by Gaddafi to aid his Chadian ally Goukouni. Gaddafi's goal is to get Goukouni in power in order to augment his chances of controlling Chad once the civil war is over. Gaddafi's collaboration with Goukouni can sometimes look a bit more like an invasion...</p>

#### Guerrilla Units
  
In addition to <span class="blue">FAN</span> and <span class="red">FAP</span>, there are a total of 12 other Guerrilla Factions participating in the civil war. Their allegiance to one of the two Commanders will vary throughout the game. Below are the guerrilla factions involved in the Opération Manta scénario.

##### FAN and Habré's Guerrilla Allies

- <span class="blue">FAN</span> Habré's personal army. Whether Habré is government commander or rebel commander, FAN remain loyal to him.
- <span class="blue">MPLT</span> allied rebel troops.
- <span class="blue">PLA</span> allied rebel troops.

##### FAP and Goukouni's Guerrilla Allies
- <span class="red">FAP</span> Goukouni's personal army. Whether Goukouni is government commander or rebel commander, FAP remain loyal to him.
- <span class="red">CDR</span> allied rebel troops. 
- <span class="red">CODOS</span> allied rebel troops.

##### Neutral
- <span class="black">MRP</span> guerrillas are neutral, or "inactive." However, these guys will turn against whoever attacks them first out of an attempt to take Moundou `1849`, where they are based, and cooperate with the rival commander of the attacking force.
Alternatively, government player [can attempt to rally them](/) with a roll of the dice at beginning of each Tactical Phase.

> The single most important thing to remember about guerrilla units is that Habré and his allies are represented by <span class="blue">blue</span> game pieces while Goukouni and his allies are <span class="red">red</span>.

> When it comes to conventional troops, just remember these alliances: <span class="green">Green</span> are allied with <span class="red">Goukouni</span> , while <span class="purple">puple</span> and <span class="white">white</span> are allied with Government Player, which, at the beginning of the game, is <span class="blue">Habre</span>.

If you take a quick look at the combat unit game pieces, you will notice a few of the basic traits that characterize different armies and commanders involved. A few of these characteristics are listed here.
- <span class="green">Lybian</span> forces are characterized by an abundance of tanks, trucks, and large infantry units with excellent conventional battle strength and movement speed.
- <span class="purple">FANT</span> are not the most capable units, even in conventional warfare.
- <span class="white">French</span> troops, although they are conventional, can be surprisingly capable at guerrilla warfare as well. Some players find that this makes the French ideal for guarding the capitol city!
- <span class="blue">Habre</span> is a much more able military commander compared to <span class="red">Goukouni</span>. Habre's skill, however, only benefits those units [with whom he is physically present](/).

##  Combat Units Setup

The seven MRP guerrillas are considered independent at the start of the game, and may not move until activated. (Place an "IGF" marker on top of the stack to indicate this fact.) If attacked by one player, they are immediately activated and controlled by the other player. Otherwise, the Rebel player attempts to activate them by rolling one die during "Initiative Determination" of each Tactical Phase. MRP joins the Rebel side on a result of 5 or 6.
